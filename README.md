# REST API and JWT Authentication

Welcome to my REST API and JWT Authentication learning repository! This repository contains extensive materials and code examples to help you understand and implement RESTful APIs and JWT authentication. Additionally, it includes a mini-project that demonstrates how to combine these concepts in a practical application.

## REST API Learning Materials
